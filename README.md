# SandPool

This is an open-source project that aims to develop a decentralized NFT marketplace using smart contracts and a user-friendly frontend. The marketplace allows users to mint, buy, and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without the need for a central authority or intermediary. It also incorporates an AI model for detecting and classifying NSFW NFTs to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for all users.
